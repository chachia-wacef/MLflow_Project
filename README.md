# MLflow_Project
This project allowed me to create an algorithm that allows to train a classification model on the famous "Iris" data. I used the MLflow platform to streamline machine learning development which allowed me to save the best model, result of the Grid Search CV method, as well as its parameters and its result in terms of evaluation metric on an S3 instance of AWS.
